In its operation operation it referred to the otodom website, it allowed the sale or rental of property, but additionally expanded the owner's ability to manage their apartment. From the landlords' side, it was possible to pay rent or report defects, inconveniences or comments. In addition, outside companies had the the possibility to offer their services in the form of repairs or interior finishing. The application had a rating system for apartments, owners ace their services related to repairs, finishing and renovation of apartments. The FlatApp app was a side project of mine at work, but I took care of its development at the company to which I then moved.",
  "work1Desc4": "3. Omnidev was a project aimed at developers who wanted to sell apartments from their developments, even ones that had not yet been fasted. Buyers had the opportunity to select and buy specific apartments from the construction plan, designated themselves parking spaces or storage units, and apartment finishing packages apartments. Outside companies also offered their services related to repairs, finishing and renovation of apartments. The FlatApp app was a side project of mine at work, but I took care of its development at the company to which I then moved.",
  "work2Desc1": "At Vobacom, I continued to develop the Omnidev application, but a big part of the work on this application was its refactoring. In it, I upgraded versions of symfony, php and all packages through a huge amount of deprecation. I also rewrote the very design basis, which made almost no use of Symfony's facilities and was written in pure php. After fixing all the refactoring errors and fixing the previous omissions, the application was developed and completed.",
  "work2Desc2": "After I finished working on Omnidev, I was switched to working with Drupal. I dealt with smaller tasks related to bugs, fixes and changes in the operation of various applications, mainly municipal or corporate websites. I also participated in a larger implementation related to an insurance company and its insurance offerings. Unfortunately, I was not introduced to Drupal in any way, As a result, I became discouraged with this crm.",

I have already worked on more than a dozen implementations from start to finish. In between between working on the V-desk application, I maintain various applications on the based on tasks that the support department reports.",
